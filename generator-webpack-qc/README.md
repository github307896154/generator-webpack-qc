## Background

Help you to quickly start a project based on [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).

In my work, I often need to start a tiny demo quickly to

- try a npm lib by `import`
- test/try a webpack plugin or loader
- write a demo page for some features
- develop a library
- ……

Without configuring Wepack/Rollup, `generator-webpack-qc` makes these more simple.

## Install

Install Yeoman and generator-webpack-qc (we assume you have pre-installed node.js).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-webpack-qc
```

## Usage

```bash
yo webpack-qc
```

## Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced. Feel free to [learn more about him](https://yeoman.io/).
